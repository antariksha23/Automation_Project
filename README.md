This project is about setting up AWS Infrastructre i.e. EC2 Instance, VPC, Security Group and S3 bucket. S3 bucket will be used to store our web server's access and error logs.
A bash script 'automation.sh' is created to check & install apache2 server.
Server logs will be copied to S3 bucket.
Bookkeeping has to be done for logs.
The 'automation.sh' will be hosted on GitHub.
